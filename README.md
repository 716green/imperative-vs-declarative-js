# Imperative vs Declarative Programming

## This repo goes with the YouTube video titled:

> ▶️ [Struggling to Learn Web Dev? Say yes to declarative code 🚀 Escape tutorial HELL 🚀](https://youtu.be/uh3WE5BaBT4)<br />
> by [DataBass Software on YouTube](youtube.com/databasssoftware)

### Purpose

- This video is to share the idea that learning a framework and using declarative code as opposed to vanilla JS and imperative code is exactly what beginners who are stuck and frustrated.
- That sentiment was originally popularized by Maximilian Schwarzmüller or Academind, the best (in my opinion) web development teacher on YouTube and Udemy.

### File Notes

#### 📁 imperative

- This code is based on the [How TO Create a To Do List - W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp)

#### 📁 declarative

- The `index.html` file will run with `Live Server` because it uses the VUE CDN
- The `index.vue` file needs to be compiled and is only provided for reference

### Notes

The example provided was in Vue.js. Vue is only 1 of many declarative frameworks in the JS ecosystem.
